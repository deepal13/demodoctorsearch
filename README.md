This is a Google Summer Of Code 2014 project for RAXA. This WebApp aims to simplify searching for doctors by applying a set of filters, the primary one being distance.
I further propose to add functionality to search either Doctors, Counsellors, Rehabilitation Centers or Pathology Labs. 

TODO: Define stores, models and application logic.

To start the webapp, 

>> Clone the repo and cd into it.
>> Execute "sencha web start" [You'll need to have Sencha Commandline installed!]
